# CycleGANs*
Practicing CycleGANs for creating monet painting of existing images <br/>
*In process
<br/> Pix2Pix model - 57.74810*
<br/> Generator Model - 70.80167
<br/> Keras Generator - 80.114
*The lower score means it is more accurately monet

<br/><br/>
Currently, the Cycle GAN I created is creating heavier loss of 2 compared to the Pix2Pix model. More work has to be done to improve the generators and the discriminators, so they can optimise the values much better
<br/>
Also one more point noted is that right now the own model, with keras is not as reliable as the Pix2Pix model, so it has varying scores depending on the model run. This has to be corrected as well
