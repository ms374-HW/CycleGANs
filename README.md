# CycleGANs*
Practicing CycleGANs for creating monet painting of existing images <br/>
*In process
<br/> Pix2Pix model - 57.7481*
<br/> Dense layer Models - 78.80167
<br/> Conv2D layer Models - 72.66255
<br/> Conv2D layer (fewer layers) - 74.13058
<br/> Keras Generator - 73.114

*The lower score means it is more accurately monet

<br/><br/>
Currently, the Cycle GAN I created is creating heavier loss of 2 compared to the Pix2Pix model. More work has to be done to improve the generators and the discriminators, so they can optimise the values much better
