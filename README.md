# CycleGANs*
Practicing CycleGANs for creating monet painting of existing images <br/>
*In process
<br/> Pix2Pix model - 57.74810*
<br/> Generator Model - 70.80167
*The lower score means it is more accurately monet

<br/><br/>
Currently, the Cycle GAN I created is creating heavier loss of 2 compared to the Pix2Pix model. More work has to be done to improve the generators and the discriminators, so they can optimise the values much better
